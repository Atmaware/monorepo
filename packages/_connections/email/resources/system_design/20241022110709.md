## Implementation approach

We will use Django for the backend to handle user registration, authentication, and email processing. Django's built-in security features will help ensure data privacy. For email reception and parsing, we will use the open-source library 'Flask-Mail' to handle incoming emails. The summarization will be done using OpenAI's GPT API for LLM integration. The frontend will be developed using React to create a responsive and user-friendly dashboard.

## Data structures and interfaces

    class User {
        -String username
        -String email
        -String password
        +register() bool
        +authenticate() bool
    }
    class ProxyEmail {
        -String proxy_address
        -User user
        +generate_proxy_email(user: User) ProxyEmail
    }
    class Email {
        -String subject
        -String body
        -DateTime received_at
        -ProxyEmail proxy_email
        +parse_email(raw_email: str) Email
    }
    class EmailSummary {
        -String summary
        -Email email
        +summarize_email(email: Email) EmailSummary
    }
    class Dashboard {
        -User user
        +view_dashboard(user: User) str
        +manage_account_settings(user: User) bool
    }
    User --> ProxyEmail
    ProxyEmail --> Email
    Email --> EmailSummary
    User --> Dashboard


## Program call flow


sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant PE as ProxyEmail
    participant E as Email
    participant ES as EmailSummary
    participant D as Dashboard
    U->>PE: generate_proxy_email(user)
    PE-->>U: return ProxyEmail
    E->>E: parse_email(raw_email)
    E-->>PE: return Email
    ES->>ES: summarize_email(email)
    ES-->>E: return EmailSummary
    U->>D: view_dashboard(user)
    D-->>U: return dashboard
    U->>D: manage_account_settings(user)
    D-->>U: return success


## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarification needed on the specific privacy measures required for handling user data, such as encryption standards and data retention policies. Additionally, the extent of email history display in the user dashboard needs to be defined.
