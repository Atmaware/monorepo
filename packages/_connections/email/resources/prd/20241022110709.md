## Original Requirements

Develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that enables users to register and receive a proxy email address, receive and summarize emails using an LLM API, and deliver a weekly report to the user's primary email.

## Project Name

proxy_email_service

## Product Goals

- Enable users to easily register and obtain a proxy email address
- Automate email summarization and report delivery
- Ensure data privacy and security throughout the process

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to register and receive a unique proxy email address to manage my subscriptions.
- As a user, I want to receive a weekly summary of emails sent to my proxy address.
- As a user, I want to ensure my data is handled securely and privately.
- As a user, I want to access a dashboard to view my proxy email and manage my account settings.

## Competitive Analysis

- TempMail: Provides temporary email addresses but lacks summarization features.
- Mailinator: Offers disposable email addresses but no summarization or reporting.
- ProtonMail: Focuses on privacy but does not offer proxy email services.
- Burner Mail: Provides proxy emails but lacks automated summarization.
- Guerrilla Mail: Offers temporary emails but no integration with LLM for summarization.

## Requirement Analysis

The project requires a robust backend to handle user registration, email reception, and summarization. Security and privacy are critical, especially when handling user data and integrating with an LLM API. The frontend should be simple yet functional, providing users with easy access to their proxy email and account settings.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Implement user registration and authentication system']
- ['P0', 'Set up email reception and parsing infrastructure']
- ['P0', 'Integrate with LLM API for email summarization']
- ['P1', 'Develop a user dashboard for account management']
- ['P1', 'Ensure data privacy and security measures are in place']

## UI Design draft

The UI will feature a clean and simple dashboard displaying the user's proxy email and account settings. The design will be responsive, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices. The color scheme will be minimalistic, focusing on readability and ease of navigation.

## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarification is needed on the specific privacy measures required for handling user data and the extent of email history display in the user dashboard.
