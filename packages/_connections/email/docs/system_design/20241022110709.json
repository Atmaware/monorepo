    "Implementation approach": "We will use Django for the backend to handle user registration, authentication, and email processing. Django's built-in security features will help ensure data privacy. For email reception and parsing, we will use the open-source library 'Flask-Mail' to handle incoming emails. The summarization will be done using OpenAI's GPT API for LLM integration. The frontend will be developed using React to create a responsive and user-friendly dashboard.",
