# **MVP Plan for Proxy Email Service with LLM Summarization**

---

## **Objective**

Develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that enables users to:

1. **Register and Receive a Proxy Email Address**: Users can sign up and obtain a unique proxy email address to subscribe to mailing lists.

2. **Email Reception and Summarization**: The system receives emails sent to the proxy address, uses an LLM API to generate summaries, and compiles them into a weekly report.

3. **Weekly Report Delivery**: Send the summarized report to the user's primary email address.

## **Core Features for MVP**

### **1. User Registration and Authentication**

- **Sign-Up/Login**: Simple user registration with email and password.
- **Authentication**: Secure login system using encrypted passwords.
- **Email Verification**: Optional for MVP but recommended for security.

### **2. Proxy Email Address Provisioning**

- **Unique Email Generation**: Automatically generate a unique proxy email for each user (e.g., `user123@yourdomain.com`).
- **Dashboard Display**: Show the assigned proxy email in the user's account dashboard.

### **3. Email Reception and Storage**

- **Email Handling**: Set up an email server or use an email service to receive emails sent to proxy addresses.
- **Parsing Emails**: Extract sender, subject, and body from incoming emails.
- **Data Storage**: Store parsed emails securely in a database linked to the user's account.

### **4. Email Summarization Using LLM**

- **LLM Integration**: Connect with an LLM API (like OpenAI's GPT-4) to generate summaries.
- **Scheduled Summarization**: Automate the summarization process to run weekly.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure that only non-sensitive content is sent to the LLM for processing.

### **5. Weekly Summary Report Delivery**

- **Report Compilation**: Aggregate all summaries into a cohesive report.
- **Email Delivery**: Send the report to the user's primary email using an email service provider.
- **Basic Template**: Use a simple, readable format for the report (plain text or basic HTML).

### **6. Basic User Dashboard**

- **Proxy Email Display**: Show the assigned proxy email address.
- **Account Settings**: Allow users to change passwords and update personal information.
- **Email History (Optional for MVP)**: Display a list of received emails and summaries.

## **Technical Implementation**

### **Technology Stack**

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. 
- **Backend**: Python Flask. 
- **Database**: PostgreSQL.
- **Email Services**: Mailgun or Amazon SES for receiving and sending emails.
- **LLM API**: OpenAI GPT-4 API.
- **Deployment**: Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, or DigitalOcean.

### **Components**

#### **1. User Management**

- **Registration/Login API**: RESTful endpoints for user operations.
- **Password Security**: Use hashing algorithms like bcrypt.
- **Session Management**: Implement JWT or server-side sessions.

#### **2. Proxy Email Management**

- **Email Generation Logic**: Create unique proxy emails upon user registration.
- **Email Mapping**: Associate proxy emails with user accounts in the database.

#### **3. Email Reception and Parsing**

- **Email Server Setup**: Use an email service provider's inbound email handling and webhooks.
- **Webhook Handling**: Create endpoints to receive and process incoming emails.
- **Email Parsing**: Extract relevant information using email parsing libraries.

#### **4. Data Storage**

- **Database Schema**:
  - **Users Table**: User information and credentials.
  - **Emails Table**: Raw email data linked to users.
  - **Summaries Table**: LLM-generated summaries linked to emails and users.

#### **5. LLM Integration**

- **API Client**: Write a module to interact with the LLM API.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Design prompts to effectively summarize emails.
- **Error Handling**: Implement retries and fallback mechanisms.

#### **6. Scheduled Tasks**

- **Cron Jobs**: Set up to trigger the summarization process weekly.
- **Task Queue**: Use Celery (Python) for background tasks.

#### **7. Email Report Generation**

- **Template Design**: Create a simple email template for the summary report.
- **Email Sending**: Use the email service provider's API to send emails.
- **Deliverability**: Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records for your domain.

#### **8. Basic Frontend Interface**

- **Dashboard**: Display proxy email and basic account details.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
