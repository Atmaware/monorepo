## **Potential Challenges and Mitigation Strategies**

### **1. LLM API Costs**

- **Challenge**: High usage fees from processing large volumes of email content.
- **Mitigation**:
  - **Content Filtering**: Process only essential parts of emails.
  - **Usage Limits**: Set maximum tokens per summary.
  - **Monitor Usage**: Regularly check API usage and optimize prompts.

### **2. Email Deliverability Issues**

- **Challenge**: Weekly reports may end up in spam folders.
- **Mitigation**:
  - **Authenticate Domain**: Properly set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.
  - **Reputable IPs**: Use trusted email service providers.
  - **Content Quality**: Avoid spam trigger words in email templates.

### **3. Data Privacy and Compliance**

- **Challenge**: Handling user emails involves sensitive data.
- **Mitigation**:
  - **Data Encryption**: Encrypt data at rest and in transit.
  - **Privacy Policy**: Clearly state data usage policies.
  - **Compliance**: Ensure adherence to GDPR, CCPA, etc.

### **4. Technical Complexity of Email Parsing**

- **Challenge**: Emails come in various formats (HTML, plain text, attachments).
- **Mitigation**:
  - **Start Simple**: Initially handle plain text emails.
  - **Library Utilization**: Use robust email parsing libraries.
  - **Incremental Improvement**: Gradually add support for more complex formats.
