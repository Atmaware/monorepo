ow to Import a Local Folder into Omnivore
Based on my analysis of Omnivore's codebase, Omnivore doesn't have a direct feature to import an entire local folder of documents. However, I can provide you with a few approaches to get your local content into Omnivore:

Option 1: Import Supported Files Individually
Omnivore supports importing specific file types:

Open the Omnivore web app (http://localhost:3000 if running locally)
Click the "Add Link" button in the top right
Select the "Import" tab
You can import:
CSV files with URLs (.csv)
ZIP archives (for Matter History imports)
PDFs (via the separate PDF upload tab)
The import interface accepts files via drag-and-drop or file selection.

Option 2: Create a CSV Import File
For multiple documents:

Create a CSV file with URLs to your content
Format: url,title,tags
Example: [https://example.com/article,My](https://example.com/article,My) Article,tag1;tag2
Upload the CSV through the Import tab
Option 3: Use the API for Bulk Imports
For programmatic imports:

Create a script that uses Omnivore's GraphQL API to add content
Loop through your local files and add each one using the savePage mutation
Option 4: PDF Batch Import Workaround
If you have many PDFs:

Host the PDFs on a local web server
Create a CSV with URLs pointing to your locally hosted PDFs
Import the CSV through the Import tab
Limitations
Omnivore is primarily designed to save web content, not local files
Direct folder imports are not supported
Only specific file formats are accepted (.csv, .zip for Matter imports, .pdf)
If you need more specific guidance for your particular use case or file types, let me know and I can provide more tailored instructions.
